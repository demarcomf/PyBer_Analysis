# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Create a line graph visualizing the the total weekly fares for each city type. As expected, more ride-sharing customers exist in the urban environments. Since traveling is typically varied by the locational circumstances, I don't think people in rural areas need cars, but when they do, it's typically a longer distance of a ride since they are further out. Horses do exist. Ride one of those, save the environment. Be better than Prius or Tesla drivers.

## Results - Unlike Weight Watchers, these are logical

Key differentiations in the data described in this exercise: 
- in terms of total riders and the fares associated, urban areas warrant more occurrences, but not necessarily longer travel. it can be expected that when you live in the city, a car might not be as standard to have since most of your daily travels will be within shorter distances and can potentially cause issues owning vehicles with limited garage or parking space. 
- in terms of average fares in correlation to the distance traveled when getting a ride, rural and suburban riders tend to spend more money for their travels because in most situations, they will have to travel further to events or restaurants that primarily reside in the more city like, urban areas. the urban living folks pay more for convenience in where they live, and in turn, won't have to pay as much for their travels. 
- one thing to note: suburban people probably go to silly places like Starbucks or WholeFoods, and most likely use it for drunken nights. getting home safe is a much deserved premium to pay.

## Summary
- invest in horses 
- save the environment in more ways than just ride sharing 
- realistically, people in urban areas should pay more (a little service fee or something) for the convenience of not having to own a car and could easily make more profit for this company -- those in the suburbs or rural areas are not at the luxury of having this convenience and are at time forced to pay larger fees for longer travel and could dissuade them from actually making the trip to avoid additional costs. 
- in the COVID 19 environment, not many people are traveling as much so it would be more beneficial to initiate a plan that focuses on getting home necessities such as grocery or traveling to doctor appointments. By offering this in a cost efficient manner through isolating certain areas that could be in more of a need to this service, it would not only appeal to the market, but do a generally good deed for trying times.
